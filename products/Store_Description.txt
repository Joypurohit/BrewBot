Welcome to Joy’s Coffee House, your retro-inspired neighborhood coffee haven located in the vibrant heart of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. At Joy’s, we believe coffee is more than just a beverage—it’s a nostalgic experience, a burst of joy, and a way to connect with the soul of India’s rich traditions.

Our Story
Founded in 2015, Joy’s Coffee House began as a small family-owned café with a single vision: to blend the love for quality, ethically-sourced coffee with the charm of retro India. Joy, our founder, traveled across the lush coffee estates of South India, forging partnerships with small farms and cooperatives. Every cup we serve tells a story of dedication—from the fields to your table. Our beans are roasted in-house, capturing unique flavors that echo the regions they come from, all served with a touch of vintage Indian flair.

With a stellar 4.7 rating on Zomato and Swiggy, we’ve become a beloved spot for coffee lovers across Mumbai, celebrated for our ambiance and exceptional brews.
